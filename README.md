# How to install
* Please first install and setup KCCP (refer to https://github.com/Tibowl/KCCacheProxy#installation-and-setup)
* Download the latest release source code (ZIP): https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-kccp-patcher/archive/master.zip
* Extract it anywhere
* Open the KCCP window, and check the box "Enable assets modifier" then click "Save"
* Under the section "Assets modifier", click "Add a patcher" and select the "Kantai3d.mod.json" from the unzipped folder


# Requirement and Compatibility
This extension is tested to be compatible with
* Google Chrome 87+
* With or without KC3 Kai
* [Poi game browser](https://github.com/poooi/poi)
* [KanColle English Patch](https://github.com/InochiPM/KanColle-English-Patch-KCCP)

⚠️This patcher CANNOT be used together with [Kantai3D Chrome Extension](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-chrome-extension). 
Please only choose one of them to patch your game client.

⚠️This patcher does not work with https://ooi.moe proxy currently. It will require changes on KCCP's side.

⚠️This patcher may interfere with other KCCP patchers other than the tested KanColle English Patch.

If you encounter any wired behavior please immediately stop using the extension and report the issue to me.
